Git Cheat Sheet
==========================

Clone a Repo
--------------------------
git clone <repo link from github>

### The Basic Idiom
git pull 
    let me see what others have done
    resolve merge conflicts early
git add <filename>
    let me bundle some work together
git commit -m “my comment”
    let me make a note about that bundle
    -m -- that’s a flag that says use no editor, use the string
git push 
    send it up to the remote repo

### Other Helpful Commands
git status
    show me what’s happening right now
git log
    show me the timeline
		to exit the log view, type q
git log --pretty=oneline
    show me a simplified log
		to exit the log view, type q
git stash save “note about what I am saving”
    My current work is not ready to be committed but I want to git pull and see what’s going on with the remote repo
git stash pop
    apply the last stashed change
git stash list
    show me all stashed changes
		to exit the diff view, type q
git diff filename
		show me what's changed in this file since last commit
		to exit the diff view, type q

### Manipulating the Timeline
git log
git reset <SHA/Commit ID from log>

### Branches
git branch
		what branch am I in?
git branch -a
    see local and remote branches
git checkout --track origin/<branch name>
    get a remote branch onto your local machine
git branch <branch name>
    make a new local branch
git push -u origin <branch name>
    creates branch on remote 
git checkout <branch name>
    switch between branches
    
### Merge with Master Idiom
git checkout master
    go to master branch
git merge <branch name>
    add changes form <branch name> to master
