BEFORE YOU START: fork this repo to your GitHub account

Ex 1 -- the basic idiom & knowing the difference between local and remote changes
--------------------------
PART 1 -- working with existing files
* clone this repo to your local machine
* look at the master branch log on your local machine
* open and edit the cold_blooded.txt file on master
* commit your changes to your local repo
* look at the master branch log on your local machine
* look at the master branch log on the remote GitHub Repo
* what's the difference?
* push your commit to the remote repo
* look at the master branch log on your local machine
* look at the master branch log on the remote GitHub Repo
* what's the difference?

PART 2 -- working with new files
* create a new file in local master called "lays_eggs.txt"
* commit your changes to your local repo
* look at the master branch log on your local machine
* look at the master branch log on the remote GitHub Repo
* what's the difference?
* push your commit to the remote repo
* look at the master branch log on your local machine
* look at the master branch log on the remote GitHub Repo
* what's the difference?

Ex 2 -- working with branches
--------------------------
PART 1 -- working with existing branches
* from master, switch to the existing alligator branch
* edit a file called "swims.txt" in the alligator branch
* commit your changes to your local repo
* push your changes to the remote repo
* look at the alligator branch log
* switch to the master branch
* look at the master branch log
* what's the difference?

PART 2 -- working with new branches
* make a branch locally called tortoise
* push the local branch up to your remote repo
* create a file called "lives_on_land.txt" in the tortoise branch
* commit your changes to your local repo
* push your changes to the remote repo
* look at the tortoise branch log
* switch to the master branch
* look at the master branch log
* what's the difference?

PART 3 -- merging branches with master
* switch to the master branch if you are not already there
* look at the master branch log
* look at directory
* merge the alligator branch with master
* look at the directory
* what files now appear in the master directory?
* look at the master branch log
* what commits appear in the master branch log that weren't there before?
* look at the remote directory and logs
* push to the remote repo
* look at the remote directory and logs
* what has changed?

EX 3 -- playing with the timeline
--------------------------
* in master branch
* reset to before you merged the alligator branch with master
* look at the directory
* what files no longer appear in master?
* look at the local master branch log
* what commits no longer appear in the master branch log?
* look on github
* what commits appear in the remote master branch log?
* what files appear in the remote master branch directory? 
* pull commits from the remote repo to your local machine
* look at the directory
* what files now appear in master?
* look at the master branch log
* what commits appear in the master branch log that weren't there before?
